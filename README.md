# Analyzing covid19 trends between 2020 and 2024

  I will be making use of the https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths dataset to create an interactive dashboard to show the trends observed during the covid-19 virus pandemic which lasted for about 5 years.
P.S The file is very huge and couldn't be attached but you can follow the link above to download or view the data set.

## Research Questions

I.	The total world population as at that period.

II.	Total cases recorded throughout the period.

III.	Total deaths recorded.

IV.	Total Vaccinations given during the period to increase immunity to the virus.

V.	The average life expectancy of different countries.

VI.	The Median age across the different countries in the world and the world in general.

VII.	GDP per capita for each country. 

VIII.	Deaths recorded for each location.

IX.	Total Covid-19 cases recorded for each year.

X.	Total vaccinations given for each year.

XI.	Human development index for each continent.

XII.	Total deaths by income level to determine which income levels were affected most by the virus.

XIII.	Monthly wise deaths which can be filtered for each year.  

The multi-page dashboard shows the trends observed during the 5 year span of the covid19 pandemic

After outlining the possible research question to be answered using the data we proceed to the data importation and transformation to carry out the necessary cleaning steps, when this is done the data is loaded into the power bi environment. We then proceed to the data modelling to create relationships among the multiple tables generated from the dataset.
Below is the data modelling diagram before relationships were established

After I remodified the tables and created relationships manually, I arrived at the model below

It can be seen that a linear relationship exists among the tables.
